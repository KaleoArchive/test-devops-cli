Or just **vagrant**, All deps have been in Vagrantfile.

# FAQ

## Why both shell and go
This test involves some different technologies, such as git and Hugo. I think it could be more concise and easy to understand by called them directly in shell. So the main script `cli.sh` was written in shell.

However, on the other hand, shell is not good at parsing configuration files and increment version by either 0.1.0 or 0.1.0, It seems like magic. So there is an other command-line `test-devops-cli` written in Go.

## How it works?
`dev`:
1. use `test-devops-cli title` get a random word as the post title
2. use `hugo new` to create a post and use `fortune` as the content
3. use `test-devops-cli update dev` to increment version by 0.0.1
4. use `test-devops-cli baseurl $dev_baseurl` to update baseurl
5. use `git worktree` to create public dir and checkout `dev-gh-pages` into it
6. use `hugo` to build site
6. reset baseurl
7. commit and push both `master` and `dev-gh-pages`

`staging`:
1. use `test-devops-cli update staging` to increment version by 0.1.0
2. use `test-devops-cli baseurl $staging_baseurl` to update baseurl
3. use `git worktree` to create public dir and checkout `staging-gh-pages` into it
4. use `hugo` to build site
5. reset baseurl
6. commit and push both `master` and `staging-gh-pages`
7. rebuild `dev-gh-pages` and commit & push
